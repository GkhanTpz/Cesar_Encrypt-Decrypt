The two pieces of C code you've shared are encryption and decryption programs that implement a **Caesar Cipher**. In this cipher, each letter in the message is shifted by a specified number of positions (defined by the "key") in the alphabet. 

### First Code (Decryption)
The first program **decrypts** a message that has been encrypted using the Caesar Cipher. Here's an explanation of its key components:

#### Key Elements of the Decryption Code:
1. **Input Message and Key**: The program asks for an encrypted message and a key, which specifies how many positions each letter in the message was shifted to the right when it was encrypted.
2. **Decryption Process**: 
   - For each letter in the message:
     - If it’s a lowercase letter (`a-z`), it subtracts the key value from the letter.
     - If the result of subtracting the key goes out of the range of lowercase letters, it wraps around using `ch + 'z' - 'a' + 1` to bring it back into the range.
   - Similarly, for uppercase letters (`A-Z`), the code subtracts the key and ensures the result stays within the uppercase range using a similar wrap-around technique.
3. **Output**: Once all letters have been decrypted, the program outputs the decrypted message.

```c
// Sample input for decryption
Enter a message to decrypt: Uifsf jt b tfdsfu!
Enter key: 1
// Output
Decrypted message: There is a secret!
```

#### Decryption Logic:
If the message was encrypted by shifting each character, the decryption is done by shifting them back by the same number of positions in the opposite direction. The program handles both lowercase (`a-z`) and uppercase (`A-Z`) letters while ignoring other characters like spaces or punctuation.

### Second Code (Encryption)
The second program **encrypts** a message using the Caesar Cipher.

#### Key Elements of the Encryption Code:
1. **Input Message and Key**: The user provides a plain text message and a key, which defines how many positions each letter should be shifted forward in the alphabet.
2. **Encryption Process**:
   - For each letter:
     - If it’s a lowercase letter (`a-z`), the letter is shifted forward by the key value.
     - If the resulting letter goes beyond `z`, the program wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet using `ch - 'z' + 'a' - 1`.
   - The same logic applies for uppercase letters (`A-Z`) but with wrapping around beyond `Z`.
3. **Output**: After processing the entire message, the program prints the encrypted version.

```c
// Sample input for encryption
Enter a message to encrypt: There is a secret!
Enter key: 1
// Output
Encrypted message: Uifsf jt b tfdsfu!
```

#### Encryption Logic:
Each letter in the message is shifted by the key number of positions to the right. If the letter passes the end of the alphabet, it wraps around from `a` (for lowercase letters) or `A` (for uppercase letters).

# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption in C

This repository contains two C programs: one for encrypting messages using a Caesar Cipher and another for decrypting messages encrypted by the same method.

## Caesar Cipher Overview
The **Caesar Cipher** is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' becomes 'B', 'B' becomes 'C', and so on.

### Decryption Program
This program takes an encrypted message and a key (shift value) as input and returns the original message by shifting the characters backward.

- **Input**: 
  - An encrypted message (text) 
  - A key (integer)
- **Process**: 
  - For each character in the message:
    - If it is a lowercase letter (`a-z`), it is shifted backward by the key value.
    - If it is an uppercase letter (`A-Z`), it is also shifted backward, with a wrap-around if the shift goes past the start of the alphabet.
- **Output**: The decrypted message.

### Encryption Program
This program takes a plaintext message and a key (shift value) as input and returns the encrypted message by shifting the characters forward.

- **Input**: 
  - A plaintext message (text)
  - A key (integer)
- **Process**: 
  - For each character in the message:
    - If it is a lowercase letter (`a-z`), it is shifted forward by the key value.
    - If it is an uppercase letter (`A-Z`), it is shifted forward with a wrap-around if the shift goes past the end of the alphabet.
- **Output**: The encrypted message.

### How to Compile and Run
1. Save the decryption program as `decrypt.c` and the encryption program as `encrypt.c`.
2. Compile the programs using `gcc` or any C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc decrypt.c -o decrypt
   gcc encrypt.c -o encrypt
   ```
3. Run the programs:
   ```bash
   ./decrypt
   ./encrypt
   ```
